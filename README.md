# Welcome to To-Do Appüëã

<p></p>

## Description

To-Do application in which you can create Projects (categories) and specific TODOs (items in categories). In this project I used JS rendering as there is no HTML (except base). It was complicated project but I learned a lot. I used libraries for JS, got used to working with more than one file and importing functions through project. I also managed to do a local storage. Very enjoyable project.
Project made as a part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).
